Feature Backlog:

- Modal Masks are not appearing, making it difficult to focus on modal content.
- Queries are stale after recipies are updated.
- Potential Allergens is not making it to the backend.
- Add Profile components ( Availability, Catering, Analytics, OrderHistory, Current Orders, Followers, Reviews)
- When in mobile, nav elements are too cluttered in the main dropdown. Need to refactor / redesign the navbar.
- add 404 Not Found page
- Order results are 20 per page, however on mobilie, this is too much. Need to dynamically request based on viewport?
- Add filter functionality.
