# homespread_v2

Feature Backlog:
- Performance: Image loads and API calls are unperformant. NextJS would help.
- Performance: SSR would help 
- Performance: add isMobile to context so components aren't constantly querying
- Modal Masks are not appearing on mobile? Making it difficult to focus on modal content.
- Queries are stale after recipies are updated. Need to refetch on submission.
- Potential Allergens is not making it to the backend. 
- Improve tag creation and display. 
- Add Profile components ( Availability, Catering, Analytics, OrderHistory, Current Orders, Followers, Reviews)
- When in mobile, nav elements are too cluttered in the main dropdown. Need to refactor / redesign the navbar.
- add 404 Not Found page
- Order results are 20 per page, however on mobilie, this is too much. Need to dynamically request based on viewport?
- Add filter functionality to order page.
